## Welcome to my page!

This is my first page on GitHub. I am just testing out the basics and learning a little as I go.

### About Me

- I am a Computer Science student at Boise State University
- I enjoy learning about cryptocurrencies and playing online poker (check out my poker YouTube at [WowPoker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYjepRuZYBjKCDg6IU4bZSA))
- I lived in Japan the last 6 years and loved it. Someday I hope to go back.

### My Work

I am just starting out with programing. Feel free to [visit my GitHub](https://github.com/shaneball85) to check on my progress. Any hints or feedback is greatly appreciated!

Cheers Everyone!
